the project, please feel free to delete this section. -->

<!-- Doing this helps us keep the commit history much cleaner than it would otherwise be. -->
2. [ ] If you're not on the contributors list, add yourself to `AUTHORS.rst`.
<!-- We'd like to acknowledge your contributions! -->
3. [ ] Add a line to `CHANGELOG.rst` under the latest version header (i.e. the one that is "on deck") describing the contribution.
    - Consolidate multiple related PRs to a single line.
