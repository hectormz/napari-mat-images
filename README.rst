Features
--------

This plugin loads variables stored in ``MATLAB`` ``.mat`` files into `napari`_.

It loads any variable that looks like an image.
Presently, that includes any array with more than two dimensions with size greater than 20 pixels (determined by ``shape_is_image()``).

If loading a variable with 3 or more dimensions, the plugin assumes that it is a stack of images, and the dimension with greatest size is the axis of the stack.


Loading Large Files
===================

If loading a large `.mat` file saved in ``HDF5``/``v7.3`` format, chunks of the images are loaded as needed, resulting in fast initial load, but potentially slower scrolling.

Slices of the image stacks are randomly sampled to determine min/max contrast values.


Requirements
------------

This plugin relies on `scipy` to load small ``.mat`` files and ``h5py`` (with ``dask``) to load larger ``HDF5``/``v7.3`` ``.mat`` files.

It implicitly requires ``napari`` for use.


Installation
------------

``napari-mat-images`` requires `napari`_ to be installed, although it is not listed as a requirement for installation.
This plugin relies on plugin functionality found in ``napari`` version > ``0.2.12``.
This can be installed via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install napari>0.2.12

You can install ``napari-mat-images`` via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install napari-mat-images


Usage
-----

Once installed, the plugin will be used whenever trying to load a ``.mat`` file.
This can be done from the ``napari`` GUI or commandline::

    $ napari my_file.mat

Contributing
------------
Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `pytest`_, please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
